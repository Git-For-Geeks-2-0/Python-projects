# Automated Certificate Generation
Any event usually involves a lot of participants and generating handwritten certificates for each one of them and sending them digitally is a really tedious task. <br>Automating this job can easily save tons of time and manual work and thus also reducing the error rate.
## Objective 
 Create a python project to generate certificates with the persons name which is to be read from an excel file after loading a template certificate in the script.

 This means that your project must be able to send cerftificate to the email id's mentioned in the excel file with the name of the person on the certificate.

### Materials:
- [Sending mails with python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsVQ_cBmEwg&t=83s)
- [Reading CSV file in python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-csv-files-in-python/)

 You can chose any sample template for the certificate.
