# Create a random selector

## Objective:
Ever happened that while playing a game or while doing a team activity you can't decide who should go first and no one is ready to go first.
To resolve this situation, create a selector to which a person can feed in names or even numbers for that matter. 
The selector should be able to generate output of the names and numbers in a random order whenever asked for an output.

#### Hint:
Use the random module in python.
