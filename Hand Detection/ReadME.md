# Hand Gesture Recognition to control volume
## Objective :
Develop a python project which can detect the gesture of a hand in the real time video and control volume of the device using the thumb and the index finger.<br>
The distance between the index finger tip ad the thumb is proportional to the volume.<br>
If the distance between the fingers increase the volume should rise and vice-versa.
