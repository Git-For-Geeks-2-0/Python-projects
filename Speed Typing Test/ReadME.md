# Build a Speed Typing Test application with python
## Objective :
Create a basic python Speed Typing Test application which gives user a paragraph to type and check his speed of typing correctly and also show error percentage. First, you need to create a UI using a library like Tkinter. Then create a fun typing test that displays the user speed, accuracy, and words per minute in the end.
<br>
Also add one of the following features:
- Make it user friendly by displaying the application somewhere rather than the terminal.
- Try to deploy it as a package onto pypi.org
