# Generate PDF invoices using python
## Objective :
An Invoice Generator is an application that helps you to create invoices and notes under the standard format. It keeps all the information about the product, it also has information regarding payments for the product and interacts with customers.<br>
The objective of the project is to create an Invoice Generator in Python. In this project, we will create a user interface to get all the details of the company including its address, GST number, location, authorized signature for invoice and then generate the Invoice in pdf format.

### Prerequisites :
To develop this project we need a basic knowledge of some models like tkinter, os, and reportlab.pdfgen.
- tkinter â€“ for use Interface(UI)
- os â€“ provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.
- reportlab.pdfgen â€“ this library lets you directly create documents in Adobeâ€™s Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Python programming language
